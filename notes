// example board

I would need to number the areas so the user could easily select where to move
I could store each number/space in a string to start with
  1 | 2 | 3
  ---------
  4 | 5 | 6
  ---------
  7 | 8 | 9

  then I could have the space that the user selects be overwritten with
  an x or an o
  each time the board needs to be rendered it can be printed out by concatenating the 
  strings together in a console.log

// players would need a way to submit their moves
indicatePlayersTurn(player);
move(space);

// the game would need a way to check if player won after each turn
checkIfPlayerWon(player); TODO: how to do this??? may need to store all possible winning combinations
  each time a player makes a move, would have to check to see if one of the winning combos was triggered
playerWon(player);

// the board would need to re-render after player submits turn
drawBoard();
